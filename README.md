# Frontend Starter Pack
This repository contains starter code for a basic HTML/CSS/Javascript website.

## Intro
The frontend of a website boils down to 3 components: the structure of the site (HTML), how the site looks (CSS), and how the site functions (Javascript). In this demo, we'll be using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/), a CSS library that contains preset styles that you can use to build your website faster! Check out their [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)!

## Installation
- No installation is needed! Just drag the HTML file into your browser.
- If you use VSCode, there is a great [extension](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/) that makes developing frontend apps much easier. Any change you make will be directly reflected in the website instead of you having to drag the HTML file into your browser agian.

## Resources
If you've never built a website before, here are a few resources to get you started.
- [What is an API?](https://medium.com/@perrysetgo/what-exactly-is-an-api-69f36968a41f) 
- [How to Make API Requests](https://medium.com/swlh/making-use-of-apis-in-your-front-end-c168e343bea3): Get data using a frontend.
- [HTTP Requests](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp): How the internet communicates. Whenever you go to a URL or submit a form, there is a request that is sent to get or change information.
